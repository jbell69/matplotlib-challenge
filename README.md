Observation on Treatment experiment

1) Over the entire treatment time the drug "Capomulin" has shown the best result with a 19% reduction in tumor growth. All the drug test showed some effect to the tumor growth but most were not significant(no statistical analysis done).  The drugs (Infubinol and Ketapril) showed some decrease in metastatic sites but little to no affect on the size (volume) of the tumors themselves.

2) Capomulin also show the best survival rates with less mice die per timepoint then the other 2 drugs and placebo.  One item that show be considered for the next experimental test is to see if the death rate change with the tumor size.  If the tumor does not change in size or increase in site number and the mouse still dies, then the drug itself may be becoming toxic and causing the death.

3) Capomulin showed the greatest tumor volume reduction over time going from 45mm down to 36.2mm. All other treatments showed an increase tumor volume over experimental time equal to that of the placebo (45mm up to ~70mm)
